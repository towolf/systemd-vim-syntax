systemd-vim-syntax
==================

systemd syntax file and filetype detection for vim

* Source: http://fedorapeople.org/cgit/wwoods/public_git/vim-scripts.git

Includes patch from systemd-vim Archlinux package and my own substantial additions.

The advantage of this syntax file is that it validates unit file syntax and highlights unknown directives and values as errors.

Still missing customizations related to `networkd`, i.e., `.network` and `.netdev` files
